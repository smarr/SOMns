/**
 * A random number generator isolated to the current thread. Like the
 * global {@link java.util.Random} generator used by the {@link
 * java.lang.Math} class, a {@code ThreadLocalRandom} is initialized
 * with an internally generated seed that may not otherwise be
 * modified. When applicable, use of {@code ThreadLocalRandom} rather
 * than shared {@code Random} objects in concurrent programs will
 * typically encounter much less overhead and contention. Use of
 * {@code ThreadLocalRandom} is particularly appropriate when multiple
 * tasks (for example, each a {@link ForkJoinTask}) use random numbers
 * in parallel in thread pools.
 *
 * <p>Usages of this class should typically be of the form:
 * {@code ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextX(...)} (where
 * {@code X} is {@code Int}, {@code Long}, etc).
 * When all usages are of this form, it is never possible to
 * accidently share a {@code ThreadLocalRandom} across multiple threads.
 *
 * <p>This class also provides additional commonly used bounded random
 * generation methods.
 *
 * <p>Instances of {@code ThreadLocalRandom} are not cryptographically
 * secure. Consider instead using {@link java.security.SecureRandom}
 * in security-sensitive applications. Additionally,
 * default-constructed instances do not use a cryptographically random
 * seed unless the {@linkplain System#getProperty system property}
 * {@code java.util.secureRandomSeed} is set to {@code true}.

final class ThreadLocalRandom {
  /*
   * This class implements the java.util.Random API (and subclasses
   * Random) using a single static instance that accesses random
   * number state held in class Thread (primarily, field
   * threadLocalRandomSeed). In doing so, it also provides a home
   * for managing package-private utilities that rely on exactly the
   * same state as needed to maintain the ThreadLocalRandom
   * instances. We leverage the need for an initialization flag
   * field to also use it as a "probe" -- a self-adjusting thread
   * hash used for contention avoidance, as well as a secondary
   * simpler (xorShift) random seed that is conservatively used to
   * avoid otherwise surprising users by hijacking the
   * ThreadLocalRandom sequence. The dual use is a marriage of
   * convenience, but is a simple and efficient way of reducing
   * application-level overhead and footprint of most concurrent
   * programs.
   *
   * Even though this class subclasses java.util.Random, it uses the
   * same basic algorithm as java.util.SplittableRandom. (See its
   * internal documentation for explanations, which are not repeated
   * here.) Because ThreadLocalRandoms are not splittable
   * though, we use only a single 64bit gamma.
   *
   * Because this class is in a different package than class Thread,
   * field access methods use Unsafe to bypass access control rules.
   * To conform to the requirements of the Random superclass
   * constructor, the common static ThreadLocalRandom maintains an
   * "initialized" field for the sake of rejecting user calls to
   * setSeed while still allowing a call from constructor. Note
   * that serialization is completely unnecessary because there is
   * only a static singleton. But we generate a serial form
   * containing "rnd" and "initialized" fields to ensure
   * compatibility across versions.
   *
   * Implementations of non-core methods are mostly the same as in
   * SplittableRandom, that were in part derived from a previous
   * version of this class.
   *
   * The nextLocalGaussian ThreadLocal supports the very rarely used
   * nextGaussian method by providing a holder for the second of a
   * pair of them. As is true for the base class version of this
   * method, this time/space tradeoff is probably never worthwhile,
   * but we provide identical statistical properties.

   * sequences for which a cheap RNG suffices and for which it could
   * in principle disrupt user-visible statistical properties of the
